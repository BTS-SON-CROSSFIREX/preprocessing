There is always a permanent crosshair while flash banged, and on scoped weapons, like the AWP, Scout, and auto snipers, but these are the only advantages it gives, after that it is like a regular crosshair in-game.

This works just like if your monitor came factory with a crosshair selector. I've been using crosshair x a lot in Rust lately and have tested it with bots on CSGO, there are small advantages that it comes with. There is always a permanent crosshair while flash banged, and on scoped weapons, like the AWP, Scout, and auto snipers, but these are the only advantages it gives, after that it is like a regular crosshair in-game. Since this program is launched through Steam is it possible for VAC to detect this in CSGO?

       "10  crosshair x is a program on steam this program does not inject files or modify anything to do with your pc all it does is display a crosshair of your choice on your monitor crosshair x is used a lot in the rust community this works just like if your monitor came factory with a crosshair selector i have been using crosshair x a lot in rust lately and have tested it with bots on csgo there are small advantages that it comes with there is always a permanent crosshair while flash banged and on scoped weapons like the awp scout and auto snipers but these are the only advantages it gives after that it is like a regular crosshair in game since this program is launched through steam is it possible for vac to detect this in csgo i know rust is a separate game but the majority of the rust community uses it if you read the reviews on steam   \n",
